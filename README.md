## Project Overview

### Project Name
MissionTimpossible

### Explanation

MissionTimpossible is a Third Person Shooter Game. Actually, we can use any Game Engine, however I prefer to use Unity and I'm currently using last version of Unity (6000.0.25f1). Besides TPS Game, MissionTimpossible also contains NPC Interaction, Cinematic Scenes, A* and BSP Algorithm, and much more that we can learn by creating this project.

### Technology and Infrastructure

- **Game Engine**: Unity (version 6000.0.25f1)
- **Programming Language**: C#

## Prerequisite

Before running this project in Unity, ensure the following requirements are met:

1. **Unity Hub and Unity Editor:**
   - Download and install Unity Hub from [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download).
   - Inside Unity Hub, install Unity Editor version **6000.0.25f1** or newer. Ensure the "Game Development with Unity" module is selected during installation.
   - Open Unity Hub and activate a valid license if not done already.

2. **Git:**
   - Git is required to clone the repository. Download Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/).
   - Verify Git installation by running the following command:

     ```bash
     git --version
     ```

     If the version appears, Git is successfully installed.

3. **Supported Hardware:**
   - Minimum specifications:
     - **Processor**: Quad-core CPU or better.
     - **RAM**: 8 GB (16 GB recommended).
     - **Graphics Card**: DirectX 11 compatible.
     - **Storage**: At least 10 GB free space for the project.

4. **Optional Tools:**
   - **Visual Studio (2022)** with Unity Tools for better coding experience. Download from [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
   - Install the C# and Unity workloads during setup.

## How to Run Project Locally

Because, right now I'm not building the project, so you should run the project locally. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone Repository:**
   - Open a terminal or Git Bash and clone the repository to your local machine:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/StyNW7/Techtest-MissionTimpossible.git
     ```

   - Navigate to the project directory:

     ```bash
     cd Techtest-MissionTimpossible
     ```

2. **Open Project in Unity:**
   - Launch Unity Hub and click "Open Project."
   - Select the `Techtest-MissionTimpossible` folder where you cloned the repository.
   - Unity will load the project. This may take some time depending on the assets and resources included in the project.

3. **Resolve Missing Dependencies:**
   - If any packages or dependencies are missing, Unity will notify you. Follow these steps:
     - Open the **Package Manager** in Unity (`Window > Package Manager`).
     - Install any required packages, such as `Cinemachine`, `TextMeshPro`, or `Post Processing`.

4. **Run the Game:**
   - To test the game, press the **Play** button in the Unity Editor.
   - Ensure the "Game" tab is active to view the gameplay.

5. **Optional Build:**
   - To create a standalone build of the game:
     - Go to `File > Build Settings`.
     - Select your target platform (e.g., Windows, macOS) and click "Build."
     - Choose a destination folder for the build files and wait for Unity to generate the executable.

6. **Debugging:**
   - Use the Unity Console (`Window > General > Console`) to monitor logs, warnings, and errors during testing.
   - Inspect objects and scripts in the Scene and Hierarchy to troubleshoot any issues.

##### Hopefully, this documentation and guide are helpful for learning and running the game project!
